1. I want to test a language model's ability to solve mathematical equations. I propose the following pipeline: we elicit problems from one model, we then solve them using a CAS, rejecting those that are insoluble, and then we test (a probably different model) in it's ability to solve the problem. Please come up with a plan, including which CAS to use, prompt for eliciting problems, and system prompt for the answering model.

2. Ok, great. Please come up yourself with a few example problems and save to PROBLEMS.md using --- on a newline as a separator.

3. OK great, now please write a new file PROBLEMS.md but put the equations inside $$...$$ and use MathTex format.
